# Julia Balbilla Inscriptions in EFES

## Code and data for the Balbilla project

This repository contains the EpiDoc XML of the poems of Julia Balbilla and customisation of EFES necessary for their display and indexing. It is work in progress.

## EFES: EpiDoc Front-End Services

**EFES is a delivery, search and browse platform that can be set up and customized for an individual EpiDoc XML-based project with only minimal training and technical skill on the part of a project team.**

The authors of EFES plan to offer advanced, follow-up training workshops for students already familiar with EpiDoc, but lacking further technical skills, with a view to empowering them to create and manage all stages of their digital publication, from modelling to indexing to publishing online.

EFES is a fork of the **Kiln** publication platform, described below.
